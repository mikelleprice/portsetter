This is a portsetter program. It can run in English or Spanish by itself. Or you can add in any language
file and it can run in that as well.

Open a terminal, and run the program

To run the Portsetter program, either create an alias named setport, or call it from the directory as
"./portsetter.cpp.o"

To run the test program, type ./test.cpp.o from the portsetter page

You can also set custom Environment variables. To do so, run: "export MY_PORT=321"
Check to see if it was done by using: "printenv | grep PORT
Now all the commands with '-e' will work
